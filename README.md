# . ​ HA Full Stack Developer Assessment ​. April 2022


_2218. Space exploration is underway and mostly done by private companies. You joined Engineering
Department of one of the private government contractors, Atlas Corporation.

In that year and age everything is automated, so survey and data gathering are done by drones (model:
Drone gen. G). Due to solar radiation the drones navigation system sometimes fails. We need a way to
keep an eye on them. You, as the most promising recruit of Atlas Corp, were tasked to develop a g-drone 
position system ( ​ GPS) ​. ​ 

### The project has the following requirements:

- API first (it can have multiple different clients)

- Functional UI (must work, doesn’t have to look pretty)

Please, document all assumptions made, all design choices taken and questions if you’ll have them.

- **API**
    - List all drones with ​ **ID** ​,​ **quadrant** ​ and ​ **current position** ​ (x, y float). Position is relative
       to quadrant. ​ **Current position** ​ should change over time. It’s up to you to use a random
 values or a ​ formula ​ that makes movement over time look realistic.
    - Add new drone with ​ **initial position** ​ (x, y float) and ​ **quadrant**.
    - Remove drone by ​ **ID**.
- **UI**
    - Display all the drones in the selected quadrant. Position should be updated live (i.e.
    every X seconds via WebSocket or polling).
    - Display a message if a drone goes out bound of the selected quadrant (you are
    expected to only work with one quadrant for this first version).
    - Add new drones
    
#### Example​ **API** ​ response

GET /drones

```
[
{
// x, y are coords
// (values sent as strings, but must be treated as floating point number)
"x": "123.12",
"y": "456.56",
"id": "45745c60-7b1a-11e8-9c9c-2d42b21b1a3e",
"quadrant": 10
}
]
```
### Implementation requirements:

- **Production-quality code.** ​ Business logic here is kept to minimal complexity to allow you to
focus on quality and style.

- **Testing is required.** ​Implementations without any test coverage will be rejected.
-  **DevOps-friendly.** ​Provide a way to package your application for deployment via Dockerfile.
-  **Team-friendly** ​. Add documentation and short README.

### Additional questions (please provide written answers to these):
- What instrumentation this service would need to ensure its observability and operational
transparency?
- In general, how would you separate ​ **technical decision** ​to ​ **deploy** ​ something from ​ **business
decision** ​to​ **release** ​something?

Code must be submitted in a git repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab), please share a link to the
repository you have used.
